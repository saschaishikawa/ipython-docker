# IPython Docker
This repository implements an IPython notebook server equipped with the [Rhodium](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium/) framework for Robust Decicion Making (RDM).

# Deploying a Container
Running `docker-compose up` will deploy a Docker container with Anaconda Python 2.7 and Rhodium libraries. In addition, a [simple RDM model notebook](https://github.com/saschaishikawa/rdm-simple-model) is provided to serve as a guided tutorial.
